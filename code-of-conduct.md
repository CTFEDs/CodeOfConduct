# Code of Conduct

CTFEDs meetups are community events for networking in Cape Town Front End developer community. We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees. To make clear what is expected, all attendees are required to conform to this Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout events.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, native language, operating system choice or prior experience. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from an event or virtual forum at our discretion.

Harassment includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If an attendee engages in harassing behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. Organisers will identify themselves during the opening remarks of every event, and will be wearing an appropriate nametag.

Thank you for helping make our meetups welcoming, friendly events for all.
